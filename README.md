**A production-style AI agent that thinks, decides, acts, and stops safely.**
*Not just a text generator — an engineered system.*

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is an **end-to-end autonomous AI agent system**. Unlike standard chatbots that simply predict the next word, this agent uses the **ReAct (Reason + Act)** paradigm to solve complex queries.

It autonomously determines *if* it needs to search the web, check the weather, or answer directly. It features a robust **confidence scoring system** to let users know how reliable the answer is.

### 🌟 Key Capabilities

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌍 Real-Time Weather** | Fetches live weather data for any global location via Weatherstack API. |
| **📰 Live Research** | Performs web searches for current events using DuckDuckGo. |
| **🧠 Autonomous Reasoning** | Uses `LangGraph` to loop through Thought → Action → Observation. |
| **📊 Confidence Scoring** | Self-evaluates its answers and displays a confidence badge (High/Low) in the UI. |
| **🛑 Safety Loops** | Implements recursion limits to prevent infinite agent loops and handle tool failures gracefully. |

## 🧠 Architecture & Engineering

This project demonstrates **AI Engineering** concepts over simple prompt engineering. It uses a cyclic graph to manage state and decision-making.

The ReAct Loop Process
Thought: The agent analyzes the user request (e.g., "Weather in Delhi?").

Decision: It chooses the correct tool (Weather API).

Action: It executes the Python function.

Observation: It reads the real data (JSON).

Repeat: It loops back to synthesize the final answer.

🧰 Tech Stack
Brain: Google Gemini (Flash Model) - Chosen for high speed, large context, and reliability.

Orchestration: LangChain & LangGraph - For building stateful, cyclic agent workflows.

Tools: DuckDuckGo Search & Weatherstack API.

Frontend: Streamlit - Custom CSS styling for a futuristic, dark-themed UI.

Language: Python 3.10+

🎯 Why This Project Matters (Recruiter POV)
This project moves beyond "calling an API" to building a reliable system. Key engineering decisions included:

Control Flow: Using LangGraph instead of simple chains to allow cyclic reasoning (Loops).

Reliability: Implementing recursion_limit to ensure the agent doesn't get stuck in infinite thought loops.

User Trust: The Confidence Score mechanism ensures the user knows when the AI is hallucinating versus when it cites sources.

Error Handling: If a tool (like Weather API) fails, the agent catches the error and informs the user instead of crashing.

🚧 Future Roadmap
[ ] RAG Integration: Connect to local PDFs for document-based Q&A.

[ ] Multi-Agent System: Separate 'Research Agent' and 'Writer Agent'.

[ ] Source Citations: Hyperlink specific URLs used in the final answer.
